From now on, follow these UI design rules for all components:

1. **Styling:**
   - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
   - Font: Inter
   - Color Scheme:
     - Primary: #FF6B00 (Flame Orange)
     - Accent: #009FFD (Sky Blue)
     - Background: #F4F4F4
     - Text: #2D2D2D

2. **Layout:**
   - Prioritize mobile-first, responsive layouts
   - Rounded corners: `rounded-2xl`
   - Use clean spacing (`p-4`, `gap-4`, `space-y-4`, etc.)

3. **UX Enhancements:**
   - Always include **lazy loading** for images and data-heavy components
   - Implement **infinite scroll** for feed-style components
   - Use **skeleton loaders** while data is loading (not spinners)

4. **Components:**
   - Reusable UI components should be placed in `src/components`
   - Always extract stateful logic into custom hooks where needed (e.g., useFeed.ts)

5. **Interactivity:**
   - Use optimistic UI updates when liking, commenting, or posting
   - Smooth transitions on hover/focus using `transition-all` and `duration-300`

6. **Accessibility:**
   - Use semantic HTML (e.g., `button`, `section`, `article`)
   - Ensure text contrast meets accessibility standards

7. **Code:**
   - Use TypeScript types/interfaces for all props and data structures
   - Keep components small and readable


These rules apply across all pages: dashboard, feed, profile, leaderboard, and calendar.
